# CareCompare

## Description
CareCompare is an application that analyzes itemized hospital bills to determine if they vary from the nation average. This allows patients to determine if they are getting a good or bad deal. This application also allows you to view nearby attorneys to help iron out expense discrepancies. This project was created for the 2024 Axxess hackathon.
